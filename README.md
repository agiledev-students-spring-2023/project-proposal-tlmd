### Project title

Motivation Diary

### What and why?

Web or App that allows users to add and upload daily activities they do to boost their motivation and positivity. It's a self-refelcting diary for people who struggle to keep up with their daily mood. Main features include authentication, add diary (whether it be a text or photo TBD), track my mood daily, weekly, monthly, recommendating activities based on past records etc.

Motivation and positivity are not about how well one keeps with a certain routine. Rather, it is a personal and emotional aspect. This means for somebody, it might make him/her happy even when she wakes up late while for somebody else, it might be very important to wake up early to set the mood straight. Some might have to move around and engage in multiple activities while some prefer staying home and doing small tasks. Therefore, this will be a diary that helps the users track their mood based on the activities they record. They can add an activity and also add whether that activity made them feel more positive or not. Then the daily mood guage fills up. Depending on the guage, the service provides recommedations for activities they can do based on their past records.

### For whom?

Many people overlook the important of self-reflection. However, writing a diary and a short notice of what I did and how that made me feel affects the mood significantly. They can always come back and see what and how a daily activity have impacted one's mood. And continue doing it if it makes one feel more positive.

### How?

### Scope

Except for storing photos (potentially), it's a simple MERN stack app with basic functions.
However, recommendation system is something we as a team can look into to make it more challenging or advanced.
